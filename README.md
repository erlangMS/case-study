The modernization of legacy systems has gained more interest in the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), mainly due
to the lack of integration between applications, duplicity of the implementation of many business
components, and the challenges related to maintenance tasks. From the point of view of organizations,
legacy systems correspond to applications that support the business operation of an institution and
consolidate most of the corporate information. Thus, it is imperative that, during an effort of software
modernization, new systems should be integrated to the existing ones to share their business workflows. The
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach emerges as a way to solve this problem, providing a high-
level abstraction between applications and the business layer. In this context, this dissertation describes a
service-oriented approach that consists of a modernization process and a REST based software
infrastructure for the development of services. This approach aims to integrate some of the business rules of
the legacy systems used in the University, and to improve the maintainability of such systems through an
architecture that allows the systematic modernization of legacy systems. As contributions of this work, we
conducted a research in the literature through a Systematic Mapping Study related to the modernization of
legacy systems, in order to characterize the modernization in the context of software maintenance and
describe the current scenario of modernization of the systems at UnB. In addition, we propose an
modernization approach that consists of a process for modernizing legacy systems and a software
architecture to support such an approach. We also empirically evaluated the proposed approach using the
Action Research methodology, in order to modernize the Academic Assistance System of UnB and verify the
impact of adopting the approach in the context of software maintenance in a real modernization scenario.
